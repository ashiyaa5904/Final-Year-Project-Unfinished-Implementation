# Final-Year-Project-Unfinished-Implementation
This is the current implementation of my final year project. Need to add the face recognition and face tracking part to be complete.
So basically, It is a Drone controller Web UI where there is different buttons to command my DJI Tello Drone. When the drone is initialised, a live video streaming of the drone appears under the buttons.
The advanced mode does not work yet since I have to implement the codes.
